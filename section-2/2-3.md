# Scala Basics Part 3

First we start by importing LearningScala2.sc

Is about how to manage the flow of our code!

## IFs

You can use if else stuff
* `if (1>3) println("hi") else println("ello")`
* you can also open it in the javascript style

**There is no else if operator...**

## Switch

It's called a match statement!

Pretty similar tho.

``` scala
val number = 3
number match {
    case 1 => println("one")
    case 2 => println("three")
    case 3 => println("two")
    case _ => println("Something else")
}
```

## Loops

For loops. We might use <- which is less than and then a dash. 

``` scala
for (x <- 1 to 4) {
    val squared = x * x
    println(squared)
}
```

And the while does exactly what we expect

``` scala
var x = 10
while (x >= 0) {
    println(x)
    x -= 1
}
```

We also have do while loops

``` scala
x = 0
do { println(x); x+=1 } while { x <= 10 }
```

## Expressions

Something to talk about is expressions - these are pretty much anonymous funcitons

``` scala
{ val x = 10; x + 10 }
```

Now we can take this expression and we get the output coming out:

``` scala
println({ val x = 10; x + 10 })
```

Now we need to print the fibonacci numbers. Heres my answer:

``` scala
    do {
            println(prev)
            
            val tmp = curr
            curr = prev + curr
            prev = tmp;
            
            i += 1
            
     } while (i < fibNumber)
```
