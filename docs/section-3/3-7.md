# Mat vs FlatMap + FlatMap Example

# Normal Map

When using map we will always have a 1-to-1 relation, where for each line of input we'll have a line of output:

``` scala
val lines = sc.textFile("redfox.txt")
val rageCaps = lines.map(x => x, toUpperCase)
```

In the example above we're taking every single line and mapping it to all caps

## Flat Map

Flat maps can generate 0 lines output or many more lines. Here is an example:

``` scala
val lines = sc.textFile("redfox.txt")
val words = lines.flatMap(x => x.split(" "))
```

SO in this case we are taking a bunch of sentences in, and the output is a row for each word in the entire dataset.

Flatmaps can have 1-to-1, or 1-to-many, etc etc

In scala you can have someOrNone.

# Example

We want to count the words in a book!

He'll provide a text of one of his books...

We have a file called `book.txt` - we copy it to the scala folder!

And now import `WordCount.scala`.

We'll take the current code and make it better!
