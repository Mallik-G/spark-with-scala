# Most popular Superhero

Someone went through each comic and connected superheroes that appeared with each other in a comic book.

For now we'll do something simple, and we'll figure out which hero is the most popular.

Each line is a stream of numbers:

* The first number is the hero we're talking about
* The following numbers are the people that appeared with that hero

Strategy is quite simple:

* Map input data, extract heroid, and store count of other heroes
* Add up co-occurrence by heroID using reduceByKey()
* Flip(map) RDD to (number, heroID) so we can 
* Use max on RDD to find the hero with most co-occurences
* Look up the name of winner

## The code

We start by loading the RDD of the marvel names and the marvel graph as well

Remember that if you load an rdd with the names, the names get replicated to all the nodes in the cluster

**The output is an Option** - a scala construct saying you might or might not have data. We use this as when we use a flatmap we only actually create a line if there is.
