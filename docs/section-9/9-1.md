# GraphX, Pregel + Graph stuff

* These are graphs in the compsci sense
* Graphs like our social network of superheroes - graphs in the computer science / network sense
* However it's only useful for specific things
    - It can measure things like "connectedness", degree distribution, average path length, triangle counts - high level measures of a graph 
    - It can count triangles in the graph, and apply the pagerank algorithm to it
    - It can also join graphs together and transform graphs quickly
    - For things like our "degrees of separation" example, you won't find built in support
        + But it does support the Pregel API for traversing a graph
 
# Graphx

 * VertexRDD type, EdgeRDD type
     - Edge consists of 2 vertex id
 * Otherwise GraphX code looks liek any other spark code

## Creating vertex

``` scala
//function to extract heroID -> Hero name tuples
def parseNames(line: String): Option[(VertexId, String)]
    var fields = line.split("\")
    if (fields.length > 1){
        val heroID: Long = fields[0].trim().toLong
        if (heroID < 6487) {
            return Some(fields(0).trim().toLong, fields(1))
        }
    }

    return None
```

# GRaph constructed

Once we have the graph we can do cool stuff!

``` scala
graph.degrees.join(verts).sortBy(_._2._1, ascending=false).take(10).foreach(println)
```

# Breadth First

What about doing breadth first search?

## How pregel works

* Certices send messages to other vertices (their neighbors)
* The graph is processed in iterations called supersteps
* Each superstep does the following
    - Messages from the previous iteration are received by each vertex
    - Each vertex runs a program to transform itself
    - Each vertex sends messages to other vertices

### BFS Initialisation

FIrst we cover the base case where the current node is the root node

``` scala
val initialGraph = graph.mapVertices((id, _) => if (id == root)  0.0 else Double.PositiveInfinity)
```

### Kick off pregel

Once we initialise we kick pregel

As long as I have value, I will call my enighbours. If I have a value I haven't dealt, increment attribute by 1 and send to the neighbours.

``` scala
triplet => {
    if(triplet.srcAttr != Double.PositiveInfinity) {
        iterator([triplet.dsltd, triplet.srcAttr[r+1]])
    }
    else {
        iterator.empty
    }
}
```

## Preserving the minimum distance at each step

* Pregel's vertex program will preserve the minimum distance between the one it receives and what it has
    - (id, attr, msg) => math.min(attr, msg)
* It reduce operation preserves the minimum distance if multiple messages are rece
    - (a,b) => math.min(a,b)
