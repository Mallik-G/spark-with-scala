# Scala Basics Part 2

## Printing

formatting print can be done with prepending f - This is the usual printf

* `println(f"Pi is about $piSinglePrecision%.3f")`
* `printf(f"Zero padding on the left: $numberOne%05d")`

Another trick we can do is substituting variables using the s prefix!

* `println(s"I can say $numberOne $truth, $letterA")`

And you can do fancy stuff - more than doing variables, you can do expressions

* `println("We get $(1+2)")`

# Regexes

Say we have apache access log, we will use regexes to extract content

* `val theUltimateAnswer: String = "To life, the universe and universe is 42"`

What we have is a triple quote syntax followed with a .r:

* val pattern = """.* ((\d)+).*""".r
* val pattern(answerString) = theUltimateAnswer
    - We put the answer in a variable called answerString
    - the syntax is terrible but bare with this
* val answer = answerString.toInt
    - There is also toFloat, and all the stuff we need
* println(answer)

This is as weird as scala gets....

# Comparing booleans

* 1 > 2
* 1 < 2
    - No ambiguity
* If you do a single ampersand &
    - Both expressions are evaluated
* If you do double ampersand &&
    - Only expressions compared are evaluated
* == compares contents


We have a little challenge - to double PI and print with 5 floating points:

``` scala
  val doublePi = pi * 2;                          //> doublePi  : Double = 6.2831853
  println(f"Value is: $doublePi%5f")              //> Value is: 6.283185
```
