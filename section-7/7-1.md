# Introducing MLLib

Movie recommendations using machine learning spark library

## Capabilities

* Feature extraction
    - Term frequency / inverse document frequency useful for search
* Basic statistics
    - Chissquared, pearson, etc
* Linear regression, logistic regression
* Support vector machines
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Decision trees
* K-means clustering
* Principal component analysis, singular value decomposition
* Recommendations using alternating least squares

## Special MLLib Data Types

* Vector (dense or sparse)
* LabeledPoint
    - predict a label with a given point
* Rating
    - Rating of user for given movie etc

Good book: "Advanced Analytics with Spark" from O'Reiley

## Code

``` scala
val data = sc.textFile("../ml-100k/u.data")

val ratings = data.map( x => x.split("\t")).map(x => Rating(x(0).toInt), x(1).toInt, x(2).toDouble)).cache()

val rank = 8
val numIterations = 20
val model = ALS.train(ratings, rank, numIterations)

val recommendations = model.recommendProducts(userID, 10)
```

# Let's run it to see what we get!

First thing we modified the dataset a bit, added 3 ratings which represents us, and particular user loves star wars, and lvoes empire strikes back, and hates a historical romances.

Most of it is the same - same function `loadMovies()`, same boilreplate to load context.

Then we use the code above.


``` scala
val data = sc.textFile("../ml-100k/u.data")

val ratings = data.map( x => x.split("\t")).map(x => Rating(x(0).toInt), x(1).toInt, x(2).toDouble)).cache()

val rank = 8
val numIterations = 20

// We train our ALS model
val model = ALS.train(ratings, rank, numIterations)

val recommendations = model.recommendProducts(userID, 10)
```

But the problem is that it didn't really work very well....

There is something we need to do to fix it - there needs to be some sort of threshold...

# But results aren't great

* Algorithms is sensitive to parameters chosen. Takes more work to find optimal parameters
    - Can use train/test to evaluate permutations
* Not convinced its working internally
    - Putting faith on black box is dodgy
    - We'd get better results using our movie similarity instead, to find similar movies to movies each user liked
    - Complicated isn't always better
* Never blintly trust results when analysing big data 
    - Small problems in algorithm become big ones
    - Very often quality of your input data is a real issue.
