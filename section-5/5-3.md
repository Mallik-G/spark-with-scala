# Using EMR 

## S3 Bucket

First we are bale to create a bucket in S3, where we upload the `MovieSimilarities1M.jar` file!

That will be in S3 so we can copy it to our cluster

Also there is a folder containing the 1m dataset.

## EMR Cluster

We go to the AWS console, and to the EMR service to click create cluster

* We add a cluster name
* We can add a path to keep track of logs
    - We'll turn it off as we know script works
* We select Spark for the software configuration
* We'll stick with the default hardware configuration
    - This will be an m3-xlarge
* We leave the number of instances to 3
* We will need a keypair that we will use to connect
    - ie a PEM file that we'll use to ssh 

**Now we create the cluster!** AFter 10-15 minutes it will be ready!

## Connect to cluster

Now we'll ssh to the cluster using the hostname and PEM file.

Now depending on security settings I might still not be able to login - we should check in the security groups.

Going back to the cluster, we can see we have a `/home/hadoop` directory.

EMR has an aws set of utility tools, which we can use as follows:

``` bash
aws s3 cp s3://sndog-spark/MovieSimilarities1M.jar ./MovieSimilarities1M.jar

# Then download movie names
aws s3 cp s3://sundog-spark/ml-1m/movies.dat ./

# Finally run the script with star wars = ID 260
spark-submit MovieSimilarities1M.jar 260
```
