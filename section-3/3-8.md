# Improving FlatMap Example

## Text normalization

* Problem: word variants with different capitalization, punctuation, etc.
* There are fancy NLP toolkits
* But we'll keep it simple and use a regex

The results are not good enough tho... so we need to filter stuff.

Now we'll use a regex in the flat map!

The only difference is to do this:

``` scala
val words = input.flatMap(x => x.split("\\W+"))

val lowercaseWords = lowercaseWords.countByValue()
```

Now it removes the punctuations completely

And we also change the lowercase versions of each word.
