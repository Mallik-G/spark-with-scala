# Hard way of BFS with accumulators

First thing we need to do is transform data for the format we need for a BFS algorithm

We need
* Color
* List of connections

Whenever we parse a line, we need to transform it to a new data structure:

`(SUPERHEROID, (...CONNECTIONS...), DEGREESOFSEPARATION, COLOURSTRING)`

* We'll start with 9999 = initial degrees of separation
* Now the code that will do it:

``` scala
var connections: ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer()
for (connection <- 1 to (fields.length-1)) {
    connections += fields(connection).toInt 
}

var color:String = "WHITE"
var distrance:Int = 9999

if (heroID == startCharacterID) {
    color=GRAY
    distance = 0
}

return (heroID), (connections.toArray, distance, color)
```

## Iteratively process RDD

* Just like each step of our BFS example
* Go throuhg , looking for gray nodes

To do this we use a mpper and reducer

### Mapper

* Creates new nodes for each connection of gray nodes, with a distance incremented by one, color gray and no connections
* Colors the gray node we just processed black
* Copies the node itself into the results

### Reducer

* Combines together all nodes for the same hero ID
* Preserves the shortest distance, and the darkest color found
* Preserves the list of connections from the original node

## How do we know we're done?

* An accumulator allows many executors to increment a shared variable
* For example: 
    - var hitCounter: LongAccumulator("Hit Counter
    - Sets up a shared accumulator with an initial value of 0")
* For each iteration, if the character we are interested is hit we increemnt the counter
* After each iteration we check if hitcounter is greater than one, if so we're done
