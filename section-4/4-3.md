# Superhero Degrees of Separation

We'll use an interative breadth first search implementation in spark, and introducing accumulators

## Breadth First in Action

We will have a graph where:

* Each node is a superhero
* They are connected via edges
* Each node starts with a value of infinite
* All nodes are white
    - When nodes are white, they haven't been explored
    - Nodes are gray is being visited
    - Node is black has been separated
* Our initia state, we want to measure everyone's degrees of separation to node s
* We make it gray and its degrees of separation is 0 as we start there
* We explore the nodes next to it, and increase the count to the connections 1
* We always maintain the shortest distance we find

How do we transform into spark
