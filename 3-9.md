# Sorting Words Results

* We could sort what countByValue() returns, but let's use RDD to keep it scalable
* First do countByValue() the "hardway"
* Instead, if we want to reinvent the value of countByValue to return an RDD:
    - `val wordCounts = lowercaseWords.map(x => (x,1)).reduceByKey((x,y)=>x+y)`
* Convert each word to a key/value pair with a value of 1
* Then count them all with reducebykey

# Sorting the results: Step 2

* Flip the (word, count) pairs to (count,word)
* Then use sortByKey() to sort by count(now that count is our new key)
    - `val wordCountsSorted = wordsCount.map(x => (x._2, x._1)).sortByKey()`
